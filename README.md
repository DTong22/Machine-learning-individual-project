# A Machine Learning Based Approach to Nanoparticle Classification

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro
Magnetic nanoparticles have emerged as a promising tool for various biomedical applications, including biosensing for cancer detection. The purpose of this project was to classify different magnetic nanoparticle clusters based on differences in particle sizes and shapes using a machine learning-based approach.

## Project Description
1. The [raw data](https://github.com/DTong22/Machine-learning-individual-project/tree/master/raw%20data) folder contains 5 h5 data sets
2. [feature extraction.py](https://github.com/DTong22/Machine-learning-individual-project/blob/master/model/feature%20extraction.py) extracts features from the `raw data` into csv files.
3. [model tuned.py](https://github.com/DTong22/Machine-learning-individual-project/blob/master/model/model%20tuned.py
) is the machine learning model that uses csv files obtained from `feature extraction.py`.
4. More detail of the project can be found in the [Final report](https://github.com/DTong22/Machine-learning-individual-project/blob/master/Final%20Report.pdf)
